 * An annotation that marks a constructor to be used by the codec auto-mapping system.<br>
 * When a class has multiple constructors, one can be annotated with this annotation to indicate<br>
 * that it should be used for creating instances during codec decoding.<br>
 * <p>
 *     The annotated constructor must have parameters that match the class's codec components in both number and type compatibility.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     If a class has only one constructor, this annotation is optional.
