/**

 * <br>
 * A structured concurrency implementation that allows forking tasks and joining on their completion.<br>
 * This class provides a way to manage a group of related concurrent tasks with proper lifecycle management.<br>
 *
 * <p>Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (StructuredConcurrency scope = new StructuredConcurrency()) {
 *     Future<String> task1 = scope.fork(() -> "Hello");
 *     Future<Integer> task2 = scope.fork(() -> 42);
 *
 *     scope.join(); // Wait for all tasks to complete
 *
 *     String result1 = task1.get();
 *     Integer result2 = task2.get();
 * }
 * }</pre>
